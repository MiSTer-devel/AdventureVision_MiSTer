### I/O Port 2

#### Pins 0-3
These pins are wired into the address A8 to A11 for cartridge access.

#### Pin 4
When this pin is set to a logic 1, the LED storage registers are latched into the LED output drivers for a synchronous display change. This pin must be set to 0 before writing to the LED storage registers.

#### Pins 5-7
A read from external RAM causes the following: 

| `P2[7]` | `P2[6]` | `P2[5]` | Description                        |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0       | 0       | 0       | None                               |
| 0       | 0       | 1       | LED #1-#8 storage register write   |
| 0       | 1       | 0       | LED #9-#16 storage register write  |
| 0       | 1       | 1       | LED #17-#24 storage register write |
| 1       | 0       | 0       | LED #25-#32 storage register write |
| 1       | 0       | 1       | LED #33-#40 storage register write |
| 1       | 1       | 0       | COP411 reset register write        |
| 1       | 1       | 1       | not used/unknown                   |

## Sound
Pins 4-7 are also connected to the COP411 inputs and are used to transfer two sound command nibbles over these lines when the COP411 reset is released. A read from external RAM with P2 at $C0 and data bit D0 set to ’1′ will release the soundchip from reset.  
For more in depth information refer to Sound.

## Graphics
Pin 5 to 7 select the LED rows group to be written on external RAM access.  
When pin 4 is set to high, all the LED registers are latched all at once into the LED bar.  
For more in depth information refer to Graphics.

# CPU (Intel 8048)

8048 is a 8-bits microcomputer and part of MCS-48 family but only this chip is used in the AdventureVision.  
Oscillator is divided by 15, /3 Counter on the osc circuit and 5 states on each instruction clock.

## Chip specifications


* Intel’s advanced N-channel silicon gate HMOS process.
* Internal ROM: 1K x 8 ROM (One-time programmable?)
* Internal RAM: 64 x 8 RAM
* 8-bits timer/counter
* 27 I/O lines:
    * Port 1, 8-bits IO
    * Port 2, 8-bits IO
    * BUS, 8-bits IO
    * T0, 1-bit Input only
    * T1, 1-bit Input only
    * INT, 1-bit Input only
* All instructions are 1 or 2 cycles

## Adventure Vision interface

### BUS
All 8 pins are connected to the socket and external RAM, using BUS instructions has no real meaning and should be avoided.

### Port 1
These pins are connected to the [banking system](https://web.archive.org/web/20160427172940/http://www.m-e-g-a.org/adventurevision-hardware/) and [controllers input](https://web.archive.org/web/20160427172940/http://www.m-e-g-a.org/adventurevision-hardware/).

### Port 2
There pins are connected to the [Graphics](https://web.archive.org/web/20160427172940/http://www.m-e-g-a.org/adventurevision-graphics/), [Sound](https://web.archive.org/web/20160427172940/http://www.m-e-g-a.org/adventurevision-apu/) and most-significant bits of the socket’s address.

### INT Pin
INT is unconnected, always read as logic 1.

### T0 Pin
T0 is connected to the expansion port, there was never any expansion planned so can be assumed to be always logic 1.

### T1 Pin
T1 is connected to the mirror’s sensor, it oscillate at a rate of approx. 15 times per sec.
Logic transition from 1 to 0 indicate that the image is ready to be drawn.
For more information check [Graphics](https://web.archive.org/web/20160427172940/http://www.m-e-g-a.org/adventurevision-graphics/).

### CPU hazards
Program counter increments by 1 in each fetch but A11 is not incremented.  
So if code needs to cross between $7FF to $800, it needs to **SET MB1** and **JMP $800** instead or else the counter will warp-around to $000.  
Program counter can cross between banks 0 to 7 and 8 to 15 freely but can still affect certain instructions implementations such as ones that take into account the lowest 8-bits of the PC: **MOVP A**, **@A**, **JMPP @A** and all conditional jumps.

**SET MB0** and **SET MB1** only take effect on **JMP addr** and **CALL addr**.
During interrupt, A11 is always output as logic 0. (Not important for AdventureVision but is always good to know)

## Programming tricks

### Array/Table read
Instruction **MOVP A, @A** can be used to read tables between the current page from the ROM area.

### Graphics data
Because graphics only start at offset 6 in each bank you can write:
```asm
.org (bank address)
movp a, @a
ret
.db 0, 0, 0, 0  ; for padding
(Bank graphics here)
```

And send the whole image bank with:
```asm
mov r0, 0
loopback:
mov a, r0
call (bank address)
mov @r0, a
djnz r0, loopback
```

### Up to 252 Bytes of data
Table code:
```asm
.org (bank address)
add a, 4
movp a, @a
ret
(Data content here)
```

To read table:
```asm
 ; Table offset on accumulator
call (bank address)
 ; Now the accumulator hold the data
```

### Up to 254 Bytes of data
Table code:
```asm
.org (bank address)
movp a, @a
ret
(Data content here)
```

To read table:
```asm
 ; Table offset on accumulator
add a, 2
call (bank address)
 ; Now the accumulator hold the data
```

### 255 Bytes of data
Table code:
```asm
.org (bank address)
(Data content here) ; Must be exactly 255 bytes
movp a, @a    ; at address $xFF
ret           ; first byte of the next bank
```

To read table:
```asm
 ; Table offset on accumulator
call (bank address) + 255
 ; Now the accumulator hold the data
```

### 256 Bytes of data
For reading 256 bytes data it’s only possible by disabling BIOS and using **MOVP3 A, @A** instruction, data content must be in `$300~$3FF`.
```asm
.org $300
(Data content here)
```

To read table:
```asm
 ; Table offset on accumulator
movp3 a, @a
 ; Now the accumulator hold the data
 ```

## Vector tables
This can be useful to implement states (such as AI).

### Up to 127 vectors
Vector table:
```asm
.org (bank address)
inc a
jmpp @a
(list of vectors with JMP addr instruction)
```

To call the vector:
```asm
 ; Vector index on accumulator
jmp/call (bank address)
```

### 128 vectors
This is archived by using **JMPP @A** just 1 byte before the desired bank address.
Vector table:
```asm
.org (bank address) - 1
jmpp @a    ; Must be in $xFF
(list of vectors with JMP addr instruction)
```

To call the vector:
```asm
 ; Vector index on accumulator
jmp/call (bank address)
```

# APU (National Semiconductor COP411L)

COP411 is a low cost 4-bits microcontroller.  
Clocking is divided by 4, four states per instruction clock.  
In AdventureVision the CKI is connected to a RC circuit (Res 82K, Cap 56pF) which provides approximately 217.770 kHz with ~13% error, this gives about 54.442 kips

## Chip specifications

* Single-Chip N-Channel Microcontroller
* Internal ROM: 512 x 8 (One-time programmable?)
* Internal RAM: 32 x 4
* 19 I/O lines:
    * Port L, 8-bits IO
    * Port G, 4-bits IO
    * Port D, 4-bits Output
* All instructions are 1 or 2 cycles

## AdventureVision interface

### Port L
Lowest 4 pins are connected to the CPU Port 2 highest 4 bits.
It’s used for sound command transmission after reset.
The rest of the pins are left unconnected.

### Port G
Lowest bit of Port G is connected to the audio output circuit, it has higher influence on output.
The rest of the pins are left unconnected.

### Port D
Lowest bit of Port D is connected to the audio output circuit, it has lower influence on output.
The rest of the pins are left unconnected.

### Reset
Connected to a circuit inside the video module, for more information check "Sound transmission".

### Sound transmission
COP411 lacks interrupts support so one solution was to use reset signal in each time the game needs to send a sound command for playing sound effects.
Internal RAM is not cleared on reset, this is important for Command 0
The CPU will write $C0 into Port 2 and access external RAM with lowest data bit of 0 then 1 causing a reset into the chip.
CPU will delay and send the higher nibble first into Port 2 higher bits, delay some more and send the lower nibble into Port 2 higher bits.
Now the APU will process the command.

### Sound commands
[BIOS $1B](https://web.archive.org/web/20160428083625/http://www.m-e-g-a.org/av_bios.html) can be used to transmit sound commands.
Highest nibble is the command, lower nibble is the data.
Transmitting a new command will cancel the sound that is currently being played, command 0 can be used for silence.
Tones are played with 2 segments but SFX are played with only 1.
The volume of each segment can be changed on command 0

### Command 0
#### Control Register
Bit 0 control the looping: 0 will play once, 1 will play infinitely until another command is received.
| Bit 2 | Bit 1 | 1st Seg. Vol | 2nd Seg. Vol |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 0     | 0     | Low          | Low          |
| 0     | 1     | High         | Low          |
| 1     | 0     | High         | High         |
| 1     | 1     | High         | High         |

Bit 3 control the delay of both segment: 0 plays slow, 1 plays fast

### Command 1
#### Noise generator
Plays noise constantly.
*Loop effect:* Always on, ignores looping control.

### Command 2
#### Slide high to low square-wave pitch
Pew Pew Pew! Commonly used when players shoot.

### Command 3
#### Play noise in 5 different pitches
Simulates a loud big explosion.
*Loop effect:* Sound plays Command 2 when explosion finishes.

### Command 4
#### Slide low to high square-wave pitch
Commonly used when player receive a reward.

### Command 5
#### Slide low to high noise pitch and duration
Thrusters at maximum power, prepare for lift off!
*Loop effect:* At end, sound continue to play from the last pitch change.

### Command 6
#### Slide high to low noise pitch and duration
Can either simulate a long lasting explosion or ship landing when used with command 5.
*Loop effect:* Always off, ignores looping control.

### Command 7
#### Slide medium to low square-wave pitch
The enemy is shooting at us! Execute evasive maneuvers!

### Command 8
#### Very quickly slide low to high square-wave pitch
Multiple purpose.
*Loop effect:* Hold on, someones ringing on the phone…

### Command 9
#### Quickly slide low to high square-wave pitch
What kirby is going by jumping around inside AdventureVision!?
*Loop effect:* Someone set us up the alarm!

### Commands A, B, C and D
#### Unknown
Sometimes it changes pitch, other times it clears the control, not much is known.

### Command E and F
#### Tone playing
Plays square-wave with a specific note, due to very low accuracy of the APU clock the note will sound off-tone.

| Value | Note+Octave |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0     | A# 3        |
| 1     | B 3         |

# Graphics

## Video circuit
Video circuit consists of:

* **Motor** – A 450rpm tape recording motor which spins 7.5 times per sec
* **LEDs bar** – A bar with 40 red LEDs
* **Plastic plate with 2 mirror films** – This reflects the light from the bar into the screen
* **Sensor** – Senses when the mirror is positioned at the first pixel’s column

### Wobbling effect
AdventureVision suffers from a effect called "Wobbling", the 2 sides of the mirror doesn’t reflect the light in the same way making the image to have different perspective compared to the opposite side.

### Displaying graphics with BIOS
The easiest way to display graphics on screen is to write the image into external RAM and calling [BIOS $03](https://web.archive.org/web/20160428041443/http://www.m-e-g-a.org/adventurevision-bios/) to display the content into the screen.  
Each bank in external RAM is 50×40 pixels, starting from Bank 1 (leftmost) to 3 (rightmost), Bank 0 is only used for game data.  
Each block start at offset $06 toward $FF, 5 bytes (40 pixels) in each column, left to right.  
Each column is displayed from bottom to top, with the least significant bit on the bottom, the LEDs are active low (logic 0 will lit the LED).  
On calling [BIOS $03](https://web.archive.org/web/20160428041443/http://www.m-e-g-a.org/adventurevision-bios/), the routine will wait for the sensor to toggle and start displaying the image into the LED bar, one whole column at a time by writing the data into the storage registers and latching them all at once, each column takes 44 cycles (61 cycles when crossing banks). The routine returns when all 150 columns were displayed into the screen.  
The image needs to be always refreshed to archive the human "perseverance of vision" effect.

### 0B – STEP
#### Adjust sprites x-step and y-step properties and adjust X and Y displacements accordingly

Case Sprite X-step:  
```
> 0: ⇒ X-step = X-step-1, R2 = R2 + 1, A=$00
< 0: ⇒ X-step = X-step+1, R2 = R2 – 1, A=$00
```

Case Sprite Y-step:  
```
> 0: ⇒ Y-step = Y-step-1, R3 = R3 + 1, A=$00
< 0: ⇒ Y-step = Y-step+1, R3 = R3 – 1, A=$00
Address: @2B9
```


Entry:
```
R1 ⇐ pointer to sprite structure [range: $00-$F8]
R2 ⇐ X displacement [range: $00-$FF]
R3 ⇐ Y displacement [range: $00-$FF]
```

Modified:
```
R1 ⇒ points to variable property of sprite structure
R2 ⇒ X displacement
R3 ⇒ Y displacement
A ⇒ $00 at least one of the displacements changed $FF: none of the displacements changed (X-step and Y-step where both 0)
```

### 0D – MOVEX
#### Move display position of sprite A pixels to the left or right.
When the new position is <0 or >149 it will wrap around. A variable at IRAM location 2E is read to determine the last VRAM bank.  
This variable (IRAM[$2E]) must be initialized before using this function. It can be set to 3: for wrap at position >149 2: Wrap at position >99 or 1: wrap at position 49.
```
Address: @361

R0
```

### 0F – MOVEY
#### Move sprite A pixels up(A>=0) or down (A<0)
Add vertical displacement of A pixels to the Y coordinate pointed to by Y-shift, VRAM bank and VRAM pointer values.  
When the new coordinate gets out of the range 0-39 it will wrap around to the next or previous column rather then the same column.  
This effect can be be misused to move the coordinate in both the X and Y directions simultaneously.  
IRAM location [$2E] Last VRAM page must be set to 3 prior to using this function for the wrapping mechanism to function correctly.

```

The BCD value in A is added to 16-bit BCD word stored at IRAM $33~$34. IRAM location $34 holds the LSB of the 16-bit word and IRAM location $33 the MSB of the 16-bit word. This function is used to increase the score.
```
Address: @39A
Entry:
A ⇐ BCD value [range: BCD($00-$99)]
Modified:
A ⇒ no overflow: least significant BCD digits (1s and 10s) else: most: significant BCD digits (100s and 1000s).

### Making an adapter
An adapter for using the 28C64 as a replacement for 2532 has to be wired as follows:
```
           ____ _        28C64         _ ____
RDY/nBSY [|                              +-  |] Vcc
+--- A12 [|            _________         +-  |] nWE
|     A7 [|  ---  A7 [|   \_/   |] Vcc  -+-  |] NC
|     A6 [|  ---  A6 [|         |] A8   ---  |] A8
|     A5 [|  ---  A5 [|         |] A9   ---  |] A9
|     A4 [|  ---  A4 [|       +--------------|] A11
|     A3 [|  ---  A3 [|    2  | |] nPGM ---  |] nOE --+
|     A2 [|  ---  A2 [|    5  | |] A10  ---  |] A10   |
|     A1 [|  ---  A1 [|    3  +--- A11       |] nCE --+
|     A0 [|  ---  A0 [|    2    |] Q8   ---  |] I/O7
|   I/O0 [|  ---  Q1 [|         |] Q7   ---  |] I/O6
|   I/O1 [|  ---  Q2 [|         |] Q6   ---  |] I/O5
|   i/O2 [|  ---  Q3 [|         |] Q5   ---  |] I/O4
+--- Vss [|_ --- Vss [|_________|] Q4   --- _|] I/O3
```

Pin 1 of 28C64 (RDY/nBSY) and pin 21 of 2532 (VPP) are NOT connected! There is a total of 4 patches required. Connecting pin 2 (A12) of 28C64 to GND will limit it to lower 4kb.
